# Block Rewards

Semux is a blockchain platform powered by 'Semux BFT' consensus algorithm.

Its native cryptocurrency is called **SEM**.

SEM is a fundamental asset for operation of Semux platform, which thereby provides a public distributed ledger for 
transactions. SEM is used to pay for transaction fees and as a fuel for running decentralised apps. Another crucial use 
case for SEM is the consensus algorithm. SEM is used for voting on [Validators](./Delegates-and-Validators.md) who forge 
new blocks and verify the transactions.

### Block reward

New SEMs are created each time a validator forges a new block.

Once maximum supply is reached, new SEM will no longer be created.

Validators receive the block reward as well as all fees contained in the block.

```
Block 0 - 2,000,000          : 3 SEM
Block 2,000,001 - 6,000,000  : 2 SEM
Block 6,000,001 - 14,000,000 : 1 SEM
Block 14,000,001+            : 0 SEM
```
After the 14th million blocks, Semux will transition to a fee market.

### Supply

The max supply of SEM cryptocurrency is capped at 32,000,000 SEM.
